# BMI Calculator

## ⚖️ Flutter Project Showcase | BMI Calculator App

I developed a BMI Calculator Application using Flutter and Dart to practice building reusable UI components and handling real-time calculations.

🔹 Key features:

       • Real-time BMI calculation based on user input
       
       • Reusable custom widgets for a clean and scalable UI
       
       • Simple and intuitive design for better usability
       
       • Focus on accurate calculations and smooth interaction

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of widget reusability, UI structuring, and managing user input efficiently in Flutter. It was a great exercise in building logic-driven yet user-friendly applications.

📌 Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
